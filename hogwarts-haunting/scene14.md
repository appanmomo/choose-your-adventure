# The Convergence

You cast the spell correctly and Delaney's spirit soars high into the air. She disappears out of sight and you suddenly feel a rush through your entire body. Your mind is no longer connected to your own thoughts. ðŸ§ 

Delaney's wicked spell *merged her spirit into your body* and she is now fused with every part of you. 

You make the most out of Delaney's plethora of knowledge and use your new powers for anyone in your way. ðŸ’¥
