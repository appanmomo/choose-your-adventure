# Quizzing the Ghost 📝

You see new ghosts all the time at Hogwarts🏰, so you calmly ask who she is.

"My name is Delaney. I have been keeping my eye on you for a while now and I feel like I can trust you. I was a student here years ago when I disappeared. I don't remember what happened that day, but I do know all of the hidden secrets of this school now."🔮

### How do you react to Delaney's news?
