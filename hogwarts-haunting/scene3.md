# Stalking the Spirit 😬

You quickly grab your Cloak of Invisibility 😶‍🌫️ before the ghost can see you and throw it over your body, turning you completely invisible. 

Keeping absolutely quiet, you slowly follow behind the ghost. The ghost disappears behind a tapestry that you had always thought was only a wall. 🧱

### What do you do?
