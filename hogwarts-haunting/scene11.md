# Revelation 🤯

Upon researching Ghost Delaney, you make a shocking discovery about her past... decades ago Delaney was a first-year student belonging to the Ravenclaw house. She was expelled for attempting to use a spell that communicates with the dead spirits within Hogwarts 👻. The spell she attempted to use requires manipulating the spirits to reap their power. 

Delaney never returned after her incident and there has been no record of her since then.
