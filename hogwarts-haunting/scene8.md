# The Room of Artifacts 🪔

Curiosity gets the best of you, so you enter the Room of Artifacts.🪔 From wall to wall, the room is filled with artifacts that you had only read about in history books. Who would have known that all of this would be hidden in the walls of Hogwarts.🗝️

"Touch the glowing amulet and I'll show you everything." Delaney's voice appeared out of nowhere, causing you to jump.😧 Out of the corner of your eye, you see the amulet glowing like a candle and move closer to get a better look.

### What do you do?
