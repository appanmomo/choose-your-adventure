# Answering Your Own Questions 📚

You have always been a little weary of ghosts👻 ever since one played a trick on you in your first year. Something Delaney said didn't sit right with you, so you set out to seek answers in the Forbidden Library📗. 

While tip-toeing through the library, you hear a book fall from the shelf📘, falling open on the ground 📖 exposing a spell. You look around to see if anyone had followed you, but there is not a single soul in sight.

- 📝 [You quickly write part of the spell in your notes for further research](./scene11.md)
- 🏃 [Convinced someone saw you, you quickly leave and head back to your commons to avoid any discipline](./scene7.md)
