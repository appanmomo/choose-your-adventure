# The Meeting 🤝

Delaney whispers "meet me beneath the castle, if you wish to seek more". 

Since your first interaction, you've been fascinated with Delaney and naturally, you want to learn more. After you bypass the first barrier to the dungeon, Delaney appears in front of you. She pleads "please release me with this last spell, to help me finally rest".  

### How do you react to her plead?
