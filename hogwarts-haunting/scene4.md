# Secret Tunnel 🤫

🗣️Delaney continues telling you things you had never known about the school that has been your home for the past five years. You are so caught up in her words that you don't realize she has led you behind an old tapestry straight into a secret tunnel. You had always believed there was nothing but a wall there.🧱

Once behind the tapestry, you lose sight of Delaney, but you can feel that she is near and waiting for you. You travel further down the narrow passage way until you reach a fork in the tunnel. 

In the dim light,🕯️ you can see there are two options. To the left, there is a faint light and what appears to be the rumored Room of Ancient Artifacts🪔. To the right, you can hear whispers coming from what looks to be a disused classroom.

### Where do you go next?
